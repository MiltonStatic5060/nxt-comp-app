# nxt-comp-app
--------------
Closs-platform python-based application to practice controlling Lego NXT Brick robot via bluetooth
for Milton Static 5060 robotics team

## Installation
---------------
+ Install python2.x and python3.x
+ Install corresponding pip (or pip3) to install packages
+ Run `pip install inputs` or `sudo pip install inputs`
+ Install nxt-python package from git (release 2.2 preferred) [https://github.com/Eelviny/nxt-python](https://github.com/Eelviny/nxt-python) 
(use [https://github.com/auryan898/nxt-python](https://github.com/auryan898/nxt-python) if broken link)

## Usage
--------
This repo is really for storing programs for demo and robot testing for Milton Static. The examples and programs here just implement existing packages: **nxt-python** for connection to the NXT Brick, and **inputs** for keyboard, mouse, and gamepad control.  The **docs/** directory contains documentation derived from the **examples/** directory and from some of the source code of **nxt-python**.

--------
To run a program, try double-clicking it or running it in the command line ( in the directory where it is stored ) 
`python test_program.py` or `sudo python test_program.py` if an error pops up

## Editing
----------
The best way to edit programs, here or in **ftc-app**, is to use a special code editor like [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). There are many code editors out there to pick from, so you never have to feel stuck with anything mentioned here.
